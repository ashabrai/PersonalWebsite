                             <p>I'm a freelance Software Engineer currently based out of Seattle. I am a coding bootcamp grad who got their certificate in Full-Stack Javascript. I mainly focus on helping build awesome UI's. Before I made my transition to this industry, I was previously working in finance. Even though it was a stable career and a way for me to stay connected with my community, I wanted to take on a new challenge in a very tough industry.  I love working on new projects and weaving through a new codebase. It allows more opportunities for me to better my skill set as an engineer and connect with other developers. When I'm not coding in my free time, I enjoy making art and spending quality time with my English Bulldog named Ingrid.</p>
